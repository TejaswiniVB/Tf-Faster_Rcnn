## Description

#### Smart Board is an app that will allow the user to click an image, and then it’ll process that image to recognise the text in it. It will also process the image and tries to redraw the image using deep learning and plotting libraries.
#### It will alternatively allow you to send a mail to the desired person with text and image.

# Future Enhancements

1. We hope to integrate this app with Miro App in the future. 
2. We  hope to recognise different handwritings as well from the person’s dataset provided, and send dedicated mails to the person who’s handwriting was detected.
